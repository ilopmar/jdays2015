This is the demo project for my talk http://jdays.se/[Grails and the real-time world] from JDays 2015 in Gothenburg.

The project repo has the following tags:

WARNING: You have to install `image-magick` in your system for the photo conversion.

- xmpp: Interact with an XMPP bot to check the weather and the stocks. Note that you have to configure the xmpp
